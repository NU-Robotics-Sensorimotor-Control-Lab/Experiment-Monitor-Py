# Experiment-Monitor-Py

Internal Python Code to replace the C# .NET code used in May's setup at the Northwestern Robotics Sensorimotor Control Lab. Uses Pyglet for graphics. Accepts data over UDP, intended to be used in conjunction with the act4d simulink model. 

Creates circles describing the range and produced torques, and a line that shows the amount of force, like the C#/ .NET code
